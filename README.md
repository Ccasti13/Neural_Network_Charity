# Neural_Network_Charity

## Analysis

What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
IS_SUCCESSFUL is the target as it tells whether a charity donation was successful

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT are the features for the model.

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
EIN and NAME were removed, asthe identifying information was not needed

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
The model is made of two hidden layers, and the input data has 43 features and 25,724 samples.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
No, the model did not achine the target performance 

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
I attempted to increase the layers and neurons
